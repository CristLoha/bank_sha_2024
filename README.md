This project is a Flutter application that I developed as part of my learning journey with Build with Angga. The main objective of this project was to create a digital payment application with functionalities akin to those found in Mobile Banking apps. Throughout the course, I gained hands-on experience in building various features essential for such an application.

The list of features implemented in this project includes:
- Sign In
- Sign Up
- User Profile Management
- PIN Security
- Top Up functionality utilizing Midtrans payment gateway
- Funds Transfer between accounts
- Purchase of Data Quotas
- Utilization of Bloc for efficient state management in Flutter
- Integration of external APIs for enhanced functionality

This project has been developed using Flutter version 3.19, ensuring compatibility with the latest enhancements and features offered by the framework.
